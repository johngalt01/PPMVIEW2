Updated 4/16/2025
some bug fixes
added Okidata 192 ML printer support.

Warning!! NOT compatable with the Okidata 192 IBM Compatable version of the same printer.

added some additional test images to play with

This is my own version of the original PPMVIEW program by eightbitswide
https://github.com/eightbitswide/ppmview

Requires FABGL VGA32 ANSI Terminal 

I rewrote and extended the functionality of the original PPM viewer.
you can choose to turn dithering on or off to speed up the display a little.
choose to print the display to a okidata printer on the LST: port.
even some brightness adjustment.

dithering is tied to the 4 levels of color the ANSI Terminal allows for a total of 64 colors.
printing is 1-bit dither, all based on Floydâ€“Steinberg.
