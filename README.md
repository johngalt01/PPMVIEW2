This is my own version of the original PPMVIEW program by eightbitswide
https://github.com/eightbitswide/ppmview

Requires FABGL VGA32 ANSI Terminal or GEOFF Terminal version now available.

I rewrote and extended the functionality of the original PPM viewer.
you can choose to turn dithering on or off to speed up the display a little.
choose to print the display to a okidata printer on the LST: port.
even some brightness adjustment.
Inverting the image output.

Dithering is tied to the 4 levels of color the ANSI Terminal allows for a total of 64 colors.

Geoff Terminal is 1-bit dither or 1-bit raw output.
