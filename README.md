PPMVIEW2.COM newest update adds bug fixes and new features. Adds Grey scale display conversion.

PPMDC.COM is a utility that just processes PPM files and adds Dithering to match the FABGL ANSI Terminal saves the output to a new image PPM file

PPMAC.COM is a utility that turns a PPM image file into RAW asci Terminal escape codes you can also alter the image offset X,Y. allows you to TYPE the VT file to the terminal for a quicker output to the display.

PPMLST.COM is a utility that just prints a PPM file to your choice of Supported OKIDATA printers. its a faster 1-bit conversion and output when you just want to print an image as fast as possible. It can take hours to output a 512X384 Resolution image file.
Max res supported is 512X384 to match the FABGL Display terminal.

Added some additional test images to play with

This is my own version of the original PPMVIEW program by eightbitswide
https://github.com/eightbitswide/ppmview

Requires FABGL VGA32 ANSI Terminal or GEOFF Terminal version now available.

I rewrote and extended the functionality of the original PPM viewer.
you can choose to turn dithering on or off to speed up the display a little.
choose to print the display to a okidata printer on the LST: port.
even some brightness adjustment.
Inverting the image output.

Dithering is tied to the 4 levels of color the ANSI Terminal allows for a total of 64 colors.
printing is 1-bit dither, all based on Floydâ€“Steinberg.

Geoff Terminal is 1-bit dither or 1-bit raw output.
